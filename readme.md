# 🧠 Braitenberg Vehicle Simulation using Python & Pygame

This project simulates various types of **Braitenberg Vehicles** using **Python** and **Pygame**, exploring how simple sensor-to-motor connections can create complex, lifelike behavior.

> 🔬 Inspired by _Valentino Braitenberg's_ thought experiments on synthetic psychology.

## 🚗 What Are Braitenberg Vehicles?

Braitenberg vehicles are simple autonomous agents that display intelligent-like behavior by wiring sensors directly to motors. Despite their simplicity, they can mimic:

- Fear
- Aggression
- Curiosity
- Attraction to light, heat, or sound

This simulation brings these ideas to life visually using Pygame.
